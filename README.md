## Introduction

The SpaceX Machine Learning and Data Analysis project is a collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts designed to explore and predict SpaceX launch outcomes. This project covers several aspects of data science, including data collection through APIs and web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following files and directories:

- **.github/workflows/python-package-conda.yml**: GitHub Actions workflow configuration for setting up the Conda environment and running tests.
- **README.md**: This README file.
- **SpaceX_Machine Learning Prediction_Part_5.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for machine learning predictions related to SpaceX launches.
- **dataset_part_1.csv, dataset_part_2.csv, dataset_part_3.csv**: Datasets containing various SpaceX launch data.
- **edadataviz.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization.
- **jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb**: Notebook covering EDA using SQL queries in a SQLite database.
- **jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb**: Notebook demonstrating data collection from APIs.
- **jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb**: Notebook on web scraping techniques for data collection.
- **lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb**: Analysis of launch site locations.
- **labs-jupyter-spacex-Data wrangling.ipynb**: Notebook for data wrangling processes.
- **my_data1.db**: SQLite database used in SQL-based EDA.
- **spacex_dash_app.py**: Python script for a Dash application visualizing SpaceX launch data.
- **spacex_web_scraped.csv**: CSV file containing data collected via web scraping.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and set up the environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarshaBojanki3/spacex.git
cd spacex
```

### Conda Environment

To set up a conda environment, use the provided `python-package-conda.yml` file.

```bash
conda env create -f .github/workflows/python-package-conda.yml
conda activate spacex-env
```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment (Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, etc.) and run the cells to execute the analysis and view results. To run the Dash application, execute `spacex_dash_app.py`:

```bash
python spacex_dash_app.py
```

This command starts a local server where you can interact with the visualizations.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request with your changes. Ensure that your code adheres to the project's style guidelines and passes all tests.
